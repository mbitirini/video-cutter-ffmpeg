## Limitations and Extensions
An issue with `ffmpeg-core` is occuring at the moment (check more [here](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm/issues/202)) 
I tried all the given solutions but the build cannot be done (although it runs locally smoothly)
Working on it for finding a possible solution and finally deploying it
